      <p>
        Right now more than ever, the stock market has become less of a game, and more of the elite becoming richer by the day. The stock market is a game that's dominated by those who are knowledgeable and can use data in order to make strategic, well thought-out decisions. That's why we made SimStocks, a stock practicing game where people can learn and experiment with different stock market strategies. SimStocks compiles data from the internet in order to help it's users learn more about stocks in the most efficient way possible while still simulating a real life environment. We hope for users to one day be able to apply the skills learnt from our app into the real stock market and enjoy the whole process.
